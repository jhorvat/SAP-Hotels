SAP Hotels
==========

This is a proof-of-concept application that was created during my Summer 2013 Co-op term at SAP Waterloo in Product Support. The application allows the user to login/create an account and manage reservations at various hotels in the application. It was created as one part of a four person project to utilize the technologies the co-op students supported, this is my part, other pieces include a web app, consolidated database with MobiLink synchronization between multiple remotes, and an Afaria deployment setup.

This project is only posted as part of a record of my work, do not expect it to work or even compile with a simple clone.

Dependencies
============
This application depends on the JodaTime open source library as well as SAP Sybase UltraLite 16. If you have a SQL Anywhere 16 license you should be able to get this to compile by linking the UltraLiteJ implementation however getting it running will be near impossible as it relies on a custom MobiLink setup that is not posted here.
